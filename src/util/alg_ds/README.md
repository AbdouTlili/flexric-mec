Algorithm and Data Structures in C

This project is a collection of algorithms and data structures for facilitating my life when programming in C.

I created this project for 97% of the times according to **Structured Programming with go to Statements**.

*Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. 
We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.*
