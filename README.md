# FlexRIC

This repository contains [O-RAN Alliance](https://www.o-ran.org/) compliant E2 node Agent emulators, a NearRT-RIC, xApps written in C/C++ and Python, as well as
patches to 5G/4G OpenAirInterface and 4G srsRAN. It implements various service models (NG/GTP, PDCP, RLC, MAC, KPM v2, SLICE, TC) and a built-in emulation. Depending on the service model, different encoding schemes have been developed (ASN.1, flatbuffer, plain). The indication data received in the xApp uses as persistence mechanism an sqlite3 database for enabling offline processing applications
(e.g., ML/AI). 

If you want to know more about FlexRIC and its original architecture, you can find more details at: Robert Schmidt, Mikel Irazabal, and Navid Nikaein. 2021.

## 1. Installation

1.1 Install prerequisites

- A *recent* CMake (at least v3.15). 

  On Ubuntu, you might want to use [this PPA](https://apt.kitware.com/) to install an up-to-date version.

- SWIG (at least  v.4.0). 

  We use SWIG as an interface generator to enable the multi-language feature (i.e., C/C++ and Python) for the xApps. Please, check your SWIG version (i.e, `swig
  -version`) and install it from scratch if necessary as described here: https://swig.org/svn.html or via the code below: 
  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/swig/swig.git
  cd swig
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/
  make
  make install
  ```

- asn1c compiler. 

  We use `asn1c` as an generator tool for auto creating new enc/dec files. Below an example of how to install it in ubuntu
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get -y install asn1c
  ```
- flatbuffer encoding(optional). 
  
  We also provide a flatbuffers encoding/decoding scheme as alternative to ASN.1. In case that you want to use it  follow the
  instructions at https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc and provide the path for the lib and include when selecting it at `ccmake ..` from the build directory 

1.2 Download the required dependencies. 

Below an example of how to install it in ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install libsctp-dev python3.8 cmake-curses-gui libpcre2-dev python-dev
```

1.3 Clone the FlexRIC project, build and install it. 

* Download the code

  Check the [release page](https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric/-/releases) and read the release notes for deciding which release you want to install. You
  can download directly the code from the web or use git in the following way:

  ```bash
  # i.e.: 
  $ git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/mosaic5g/flexric.git 
  # i.e. git checkout v1.0.0. 
  # There are rolling updates on `dev` branch that we consider unstable before releasing and tagging into master branch.
  # You can play with new features on dev branch checking it out with $git checkout dev instead of the command below
  $ git checkout <here put the release tag>
  
  ```

* Build 

  ```bash
  $ cd flexric && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make 
  ```

* Install

  You can install the Service Models (SM) and the configuration file in your computer via:
  ```bash
  sudo make install
  ```
  By default the service model libraries will be installed in the path /usr/local/lib/flexric while the
  configuration file in /usr/local/etc/flexric. 

1.4 Test (optional step)

There are some tests you can run. Precisely:
* Service Model unit test. See directory `build/test/sm`
* 3 nodes test. See directory `build/examples/xApp/c/monitor`. This test check a simulated scenario using an E2 node's agent emulator that uses random data
  filled via `fill_kpm_ind_data()` function in the code. Example of run with 3 terminals for easying the console output:
    ```bash
    # terminal 1: start E2 Node agent
    $ ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb
    # terminal 2: start nearRT-RIC
    $ ./build/examples/ric/nearRT-RIC
    # terminal 3
    $ ./build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_mac_rlc_pdcp_moni
    ```
* All-in-one test. See directory `build/test/agent-ric-xapp`

Most of the tests can also be triggered by `ctest` automation framework. You would need to install ctest as further dependency if you want to use this
feature. From the build directory it is sufficent to launch `ctest` to launch the tests.

## 2. Usage/deployment

Before starting the nearRT-RIC, check that the IP address where your nearRT-RIC will be listening is the desired one at `/usr/local/etc/flexric/flexric.conf`.
Infact the default configuration assumes all the components are located in the same localhost. 

Start the nearRT-RIC with:
```bash
$ ./build/examples/ric/nearRT-RIC
```

Start one or multiple E2 node Agent emulators using default configuration
```bash
$ ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_cu
$ ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_du
```
or a customized one, i.e.:
```bash
$ ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_cu -c ~/flexric1.conf  &
$ ./build/examples/emulator/agent/emu_agent_gnb_du -c ~/flexric2.conf &
```
where, for example, flexric1.conf is: 
```
[NEAR-RIC]
NEAR_RIC_IP = 127.0.0.1

[XAPP]
DB_PATH = /tmp/
DB_NAME = xapp_db1
```

flexric2.conf is: 

```
[NEAR-RIC]
NEAR_RIC_IP = 127.0.0.1

[XAPP]
DB_PATH = /tmp/
DB_NAME = xapp_db2
```

Next, you can fetch some statistics from the E2 Agents using python xApps via `$ python3 build/examples/xApp/python3/xapp_gtp_moni.py`, while in other window you can start a second xApp developed in c `$ build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_mac_rlc_pdcp_moni`

You can also start wireshark and see how E2AP messages are flowing on the network interfaces.

At this point, FlexRIC is working correctly in your computer and you have already tested the multi-agent, multi-xApp and multi-language capabilities. 

The latency that you observe in your monitor xApp is the latency from the E2 Agent to the nearRT-RIC and xApp. In modern computers the latency should be around 200 microseconds or 50x faster than the O-RAN specified maximum nearRT-RIC latency of 10 ms.
Additionally, all the data received in the xApp has also been written to /tmp/xapp_db* in case that offline data processing is wanted (e.g., Machine
Learning/Artificial Intelligence applications). Please, check the example folder for other working xApp use cases.

## 3. Integration with RAN and example of deployment

### 3.1 Integration with OpenAirInterface 4G/5G RAN

We will use a patch provided in flexric repository. Below the commands to achieve that. Substitute the pathtoflexricsrc for your use-case
```bash
$ git clone https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g.git oai
$ cd oai/
$ git checkout 2022.41
$ git am <pathtoflexricsrc>/flexric/multiRAT/oai/oai.patch --whitespace=nowarn
$ source oaienv
$ cd cmake_targets
$ ./build_oai -I -w USRP -i  #For OAI first time installation. it will install some dependencies
$ ./build_oai --eNB --gNB -c -C -w USRP --ninja
```

The compilation of OAI may take 10 minutes. Example configuration files using a B210 USRP are provided in flexric to facilitate the integration.

### 3.2 Integration with srsRAN 4G RAN

Install srsRAN from source following [their](https://docs.srsran.com/en/latest/general/source/1_installation.html#installation-from-source) instructions.

We will use a patch provided in the flexric repository. Below the commands to that:
```bash
cd path/to/srsran
git checkout release_21_10
git am path/to/flexric/multiRAT/srsran/srsenb.patch --whitespace=nowarn
mkdir build && cmake .. && make -j8 
cd srsenb/src/
sudo ./srsenb
```

### 3.3 (opt) Synchronize clock

Before running the various components (RAN/flexric), you probably want to align the machines' clock. At this aim, you can use `ptp4l` in all the machines
involved (if you have for example deploed the various components on different hosts)

```bash
sudo ptp4l -m -i InterfaceName #for master
sudo ptp4l -m -i InterfaceName -s #for slaves
```

![alt text](fig/2.png)

Following make sure that no ntpd, chrondy or timesyncd is running in the system (e.g., `sudo systemctl stop systemd-timesyncd`). 

```bash
sudo phc2sys -m -s InterfaceName -w
```

### 3.4 Start the processes

* Start some eNodeB/gNodeB

  Below an example with 5G or 4G OAI gNodeB/eNodeB
  ```bash
  # eNB
  $ cd oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build
  $ sudo ./lte-softmodem -O path/to/flexric/multiRAT/oai/enb.band7.tm1.25PRB.usrpb210.replay.conf

  # gNB
  $ cd oai/cmake_targets/ran_build/build
  $ sudo ./nr-softmodem -O path/to/flexric/multiRAT/oai/gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.usrpb210.conf --sa -E --continuous-tx
  ```

* Start the nearRT-RIC

  ```bash
  $ ./build/examples/ric/nearRT-RIC
  ```

* Start different xApps

  e.g, start the monitoring xApp with `build/examples/xApp/c/monitor/xapp_mac_rlc_pdcp_moni`. The monitoring sequence diagram is represented below: 

  ![alt text](fig/4.png)


  e.g, start the slicing control xApp via `$ python3 build/examples/xApp/python3/xapp_slice_moni_ctrl.py`. The controlling sequence diagram is represented below:
